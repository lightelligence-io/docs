      <description>You got started with setting up a Raspberry Pi and transmitting configuration data such as the IP address to the OLT platform. See Connecting a Device in 3 Steps.
By walking through the process manually, you got an idea of how the elements of the OLT platform interact. see Walking Through the OLT Portal, Step by Step.
Now we add a new device type, to cover a typical IoT scenario: Storing time series sensor data in the OLT platform, and retrieving the data.</description>

      <description>Besides reading sensor data, executing commands on devices is another basic IoT use case.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s write values to devices, to trigger actions.
In the JSON schema of a device type, we have another dedicated property for this, actions.
While the attributes property is read-only, the actions property is write-only.
Actions are commands that a device can execute.
In the following example light up an RGB LED by sending a certain color code in 2 steps:</description>
