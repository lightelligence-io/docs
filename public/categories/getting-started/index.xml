      <description>A Raspberry Pi is an ideal companion for the first steps on your journey.
Connect a Raspberry Pi to the OLT platform in three easy steps:
 Flash an operating system onto a Raspberry Pi. In the OLT portal, register to the OLT platform. Let a Bash script connect your Raspberry PI to the OLT platform and let and display the temperature and the IP address the Raspberry Pi transmits to the OLT platform.</description>

      <description>In the first scenario, our Bash script connects an existing device to the OLT platform automatically, in our example a Raspberry Pi.
Now we describe how you would connect a device manually.
The process gives you
 an idea of the components of a solution, especially how we guarantee secure communication an overview of the OLT portal functions  The OLT platform talks MQTT with the devices attached, so we want to achieve that your device exchanges MQTT messages with the OLT platform.</description>

      <description>Understanding the Concepts You now know some basic concepts:
 A tenant owns the physical devices in an IoT system landscapes.
You create a tenant by registering to the OLT platform.
 A device type describes the capabilities of a class of devices: which data they can exchange with the OLT platform.
You can create and edit device types for device classes such as sensors, actors, or gateways in the OLT portal.</description>
