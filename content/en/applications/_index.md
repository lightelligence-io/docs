Design your OLT travel experience with custom applications. 

Explore your IoT system landscape(s) and exploit its data resources. As the tour guide of your end users, develop custom applications to shape the lookout points and views on the data that your IoT system landscapes deliver. 

With custom applications you access the OLT API endpoints (https://api.lightelligence.io/v1/api-collection) and manage them.
