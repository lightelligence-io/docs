## Custom Roles and Permissions for Applications

By default, the OLT platform checks whether a user has the `read` or `write` OLT permission to access a specific endpoint.

With custom applications, you access the OLT API endpoints. With custom roles, you can assign **custom** permissions to control on a more granular level what a user is allowed to do with a custom application.

So, a part of designing custom applications is to determine whether you wish to define custom roles.

If you decide to implement a custom role concept and to develop custom applications that implement custom permissions, follow the instructions under [Defining Custom Permissions and Roles](/applications/defining-custom-permissions/).
