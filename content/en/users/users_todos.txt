List your Tenants
To list your currently assigned tenants make a GET request to the endpoint v1/users/{userId}/tenants to access the tenants you are assigned to. Your userId is available in the developer section of the OLT-Portal. Alternatively you can decode your access token with a jwt library in your code and take the subproperty, which is your userId, from the decoded data section. Currently only one tenant per user is allowed.
curl -X GET \
  https://api.lightelligence.io/v1/users/{userId}/tenants \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
var token = '{TOKEN}';
var userId = '{userId}';
var apiUrl = 'https://api.lightelligence.io/v1/users/' + userId + '/tenants';

var headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token,
  'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

var options = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: headers,
};

fetch(apiUrl, options)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json));
The response should be similar to this:
{
  "meta": {
    "page": 0,
    "pageSize": 10
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "546acca5-796c-4d48-9873-cd5ae261098b",
      "name": "My Corporation",
      "role": "owner"
    }
  ]
}

<!-- todo 10 --> this is obsolete as of 20190 Q2: "tenant_user_management:read" is not available for custom apps, so it can be done only in the portal. Possibly in 2019 Q3, see app management.

Alternatively, make a `POST` request to the [`/tenants/{tenantId}/invites`](https://api.lightelligence.io/v1/api-collection/#tag/user-management/paths/~1tenants~1{tenantId}~1invites/post) endpoint.

@Simon: But: How do I identify the UUID of roles I want to assign to a user? which API call to use, I can't identify an appropriate one
