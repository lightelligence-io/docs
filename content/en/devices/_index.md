To connect your actual IoT system landscape to the OLT platform, replicate the processes you implemented in the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) section of your OLT user journey. 

Add one device after the other, according to the travel plan you have prepared under [Mapping the OLT Landscape](/users/).

Keep in touch with the places you have visited during your OLT journey: Monitor your devices and keep their firmware and configurations up-to-date.
